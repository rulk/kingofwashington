# King of Washington
"Unexpected happened! A magical tornado descended on your kingdom and moved it to another world! 

There are good news, too: all your noble Knights of the Round Table, your treasury and your peasants were moved with you. And bad news as well: you are now in the middle of a country named USA!" 

##Genre
King of Washington is a management quest where you must resolve new issues unfamiliar to the king and try to retain the loyalty of your lieges as well as this new foreign world.
